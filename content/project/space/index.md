This long term project uses Gaussian Process emulation and Bayesian Calibration to aid the extension of the Met Office's Unified Model into the upper atmosphere.

The Unified Model has a huge computational requirement to run, but also significant expense if required for the design of experiments to building emulators of the weather forecast model.

In collaboration with Prof. Anasuya Aruliah (UCL), Prof. David Jackson (UK Met Office) and Prof. Serge Guillas (UCL).
