I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistical Science at UCL. Under the supervision of [Prof. Serge Guillas](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/sergeguillas) and in partnership with the [UK Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk) I research Gaussian Process emulation of weather and climate models. The goal is to develop tools for calibrating the next generation of [exascale simulation models](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/lfric).
